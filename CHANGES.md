bug 1 - Close bracket in noteService.ts

bug 2 (this was a freebie as was commented in noteServices) - Incorrect HTTP method for updating - using POST instead of PUT

bug 3 - updates/new notes not happening as note form wasn't using the onSubmit function it was being passed from the page.
tidied up console.logs on main page

not bug just meg question? why no post endpoint in route it works I just am interested in why
